  "Hey, I’m Sagar, a software engineer currently learning and working in frontend development. My journey into tech began during my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. As part of our curriculum, we had a few computer science subjects, and that’s where my interest in technology started to grow. Curious and excited, I began exploring programming and web development - learning through YouTube tutorials, online courses, and lots of hands-on practice. What started as curiosity soon turned into a real passion for creating digital experiences, and that’s how my journey as a developer began.";
